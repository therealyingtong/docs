Welcome to the official resources page of the ZKProof Standardization effort.

## About ZKProof

ZKProof is an open-industry academic initiative that seeks to mainstream zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography through an inclusive, community-driven standardization process that focuses on interoperability and security. Annually-held ZKProof workshops, attended by world-renowned cryptographers, practitioners and industry leaders, are the optimal forum for discussing new proposals, reviewing cutting edge projects and advancing a community reference document that will ultimately serve as a trusted specification for the implementation of ZKP schemes and protocols. To learn more, visit our [main site](https://zkproof.org/about/).

## What Documentation

This page is a collection of all the different documentation related to the ZKProof Standardization effort. From the code of conduct, to paper submissions and workshop notes, all documents are free to use and are distributed under the [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.ast). Specifically, the [ZKProof Community Reference](/reference) document should be used as a reference for best practice of the field of zero-knowledge proofs, and is a result of a collaboration between dozens of researchers, developers and practitioners.
