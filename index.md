Welcome to the official resources page of the ZKProof Standardization effort.

## About ZKProof

ZKProof is an open-industry academic initiative that seeks to mainstream zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) cryptography through an inclusive, community-driven standardization process that focuses on interoperability and security. Annually-held ZKProof workshops, attended by world-renowned cryptographers, practitioners and industry leaders, are the optimal forum for discussing new proposals, reviewing cutting edge projects and advancing a community reference document that will ultimately serve as a trusted specification for the implementation of ZKP schemes and protocols. To learn more, visit the [main ZKProof site](https://zkproof.org/about/).

## What Documentation

This page is a collection of all the different documentation related to the ZKProof Standardization effort. From the [code of conduct](/general#code-of-conduct), to [paper submissions](/standards/proposals) and workshop notes, all documents are free to use and are distributed under the [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.ast). Specifically, the [ZKProof Community Reference](/reference.pdf) document should be used as a reference for best practice of the field of zero-knowledge proofs, and is a result of a collaboration between dozens of researchers, developers and practitioners.  


## Quick Links

- Latest version of the [ZKProof Community Reference](/reference.pdf) document
- [Papers accepted](/standards/proposals) to the [3rd ZKProof Workshop - Home Edition](https://zkproof.org/events/workshop3)
