## Why Best Practices

Best practices enable the field to develop in the proper way, by bringing together a common set of guidelines derived from experience, that allow others working on the field to ensure the right security and interoperability for their system.

## Latest Version

We have published [version 0.2 of the document](/docs/pages/reference/reference.pdf), dated December 31, 2019. We thank all the received contributions. You can see the specific changes in this [diff file](/docs/pages/reference/diffs/diff-v0.2-from-v0.1.pdf). To finalize this cycle of development of the ZKProof Community Reference, and prepare for the next one, we are opening a call for feedback on the current version.

### Higlights of the new version

- A consolidated preamble: new abstract, new context “About this community reference”, new IP expectations; more detailed “Table of contents”; new “Executive summary”.
- A “Version history” section and an “Acknowledgments” section after the main chapters.
- A new chapter on “Construction paradigms”, encompassing the previous section on “Taxonomy” of constructions, and including a new section on “Interactivity”.
- Several portions of revised text and content, for example on proofs of knowledge vs. membership, benchmark parameters, gadgets, and applications.


### Call for Feedback 
  
The period **Jan 01 to Mar 31 (2019)** is open for public feedback on all aspects of the ZKProof Community Reference version 0.2. The feedback will be helpful to prepare topics of discussion at the [3rd ZKProof workshop (April 04–06)](https://zkproof.org/events/workshop3), which will kick-off a new cycle open to contributions. Please send your feedback by email to [editors@zkproof.org](maitlo:editors@zkproof.org). When commenting on specific portions of text, please refer to the line numbers in the ["annotated changes" version](/docs/pages/reference/diffs/changes-v0.2-from-v0.1.pdf). Note that the [ZKProof community forum](https://community.zkproof.org) also remains as a resource for community discussion.

**Here is a list of examples of feedback we are looking for**

- What portions of technical text can benefit from further clarification?
- What basic concepts to further clarify, such as membership vs. knowledge, etc?
- Each item in section 2.3 should be expanded into a new section — what to include?
- What new pictorial examples (diagrams, etc.) to add?
- What bibliographic references to add, to better support the claims and concepts?
