# Community Reference
{: .no_toc }

The ZKProof Community Reference is one of the ways that ZKProof promotes best practices. Best practices enable the field to develop in the proper way, by bringing together a common set of guidelines derived from experience, that allow others working on the field to ensure the security and interoperability for their system.

## [Version 0.3](/pages/reference/versions/ZkpComRef-0-3.pdf)

In a nutshell, the main update from [v0.2](/pages/reference/versions/ZkpComRef-0-2.pdf) to [v0.3](/pages/reference/versions/ZkpComRef-0-3.pdf), compiled on 2022-July-17, was the revision of the **paradigms** chapter.

The old section "Taxonomy of constructions" was replaced by a new section with "background" and then two sections on "Information-Theoretic Proof Systems" and "Cryptographic Compilers" were added. This change was inspired by Yuval Ishai's blog posts on IT proof systems [[1]([1](https://zkproof.org/2020/08/12/information-theoretic-proof-systems/)),[2](https://zkproof.org/2020/10/15/information-theoretic-proof-systems-part-ii/)].

The "IP based" subsection (under "Linear IOP") was provided by Justin Thaler. The revised chapter was structured and edited by the ZKProof Editors. Various editorial corrections were externally suggested, during the public review phase. Some were incorporated, others are queued for future revisions. Suggestions from Jens Groth improved Table 1.1 in Section 1.2. We are grateful for the many contributions!

**Upcoming:** The call for contributions toward v0.4 will be published soon


## [Version 0.2](/pages/reference/versions/ZkpComRef-0-2.pdf)

On 2019-December-31, the editors of the ZKProof Community Reference published [version 0.2 of the document](/pages/reference/reference.pdf). We thank all the received contributions. See the specific changes are marked in a [diff file](/pages/reference/diffs/diff-v0.2-from-v0.1.pdf). Highlights of v0.2:
- A consolidated preamble: new abstract, new context “About this community reference”, new IP expectations; more detailed “Table of contents”; new “Executive summary”.
- A “Version history” section and an “Acknowledgments” section after the main chapters.
- A new chapter on “Construction paradigms”, encompassing the previous section on “Taxonomy” of constructions, and including a new section on “Interactivity”.
- Several portions of revised text and content, for example on proofs of knowledge vs. membership, benchmark parameters, gadgets, and applications.

### Call for Feedback 
  
We are open for public feedback on all aspects of the ZKProof Community Reference version 0.2. The feedback will be helpful to prepare topics of discussion at the [3rd ZKProof workshop (April 20 – May 21)](https://zkproof.org/events/workshop3), which will kick-off a new cycle open to contributions. Please send your feedback by email to [editors@zkproof.org](mailto:editors@zkproof.org). When commenting on specific portions of text, please refer to the line numbers in the ["annotated changes" version](/pages/reference/diffs/changes-v0.2-from-v0.1.pdf). Note that the [ZKProof community forum](https://community.zkproof.org) also remains as a resource for community discussion.

**Here is a list of examples of feedback we are looking for**

- What portions of technical text can benefit from further clarification?
- What basic concepts to further clarify, such as membership vs. knowledge, etc?
- Each item in section 2.3 should be expanded into a new section — what to include?
- What new pictorial examples (diagrams, etc.) to add?
- What bibliographic references to add, to better support the claims and concepts?
