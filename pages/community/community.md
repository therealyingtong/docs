# ZKProof Community

The ZKProof effort is powered by its community members, each participating with their own contributions. Together, the community is leading the way to establishing reference material and standards for the industry. The main technical discussions of the community happen in the [community forum](https://community.zkproof.org) and in the official [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/D2rM5hCAvT2tN4Tyw2WMZQ).

# Badges

The badges enhance the feeling of community and incentivize people to connect to the community culture. In order to issue the badges, we use the open source [badgr platform](https://info.badgr.com/) (the European server), which is the leading digital badging system in the world. It implements the [Open Badges 2.0 Assertion specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0Final/index.html#Assertion), which verifies badges cryptographically. You can find the [badgr ZKProof profile here](https://eu.badgr.com/public/issuers/1W-1RPmgQ-mj3BJSuY58HA/badges). 

Once you received a badge, you can (1) download the badge as a png image, which contains JSON metadata information about the validity of the badge; and (2) you can create your own bdger profile and keep track of all your badges there. There ar two types of badges, as explained below, and all are verifiable through the website.

## Accomplishment Badges

These badges are awarded for specific accomplishments and contributions to the effort and the community. The badges use the analogy of mythical creatures to exemplify the rarity of the people who dedicate their time to leading the effort and the industry.
