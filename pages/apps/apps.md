# ZKProof Wiki of Concrete Applications

This webpage (ongoing work) intends to list many references about possible applications of ZKPs.


**How to suggest an application:** Each item should consist of a title, a succinct description (not more than 3 sentences) and adequate references (with external hyperlinks). You may submit your suggestions via the  https://forms.gle/22vTFDU9tfWpbjBc7 Google form, or send an email to the ZKProof editors: editors (at) zkproof (dot) org. Note that this is not intended as a list of papers about [ZKP schemes](https://hackmd.io/u0obRmTRS0eRzWmVVkTtSA), but rather of **applications** where ZKPs play a relevant role.


## Legend of useful terms
- ZKP: zero-knowledge proof
- ZKPoK: zero-knowledge proof of knowledge


## List of real-world computer-based ZKP applications
1. **Schnorr Signature:** [\[1989\]](https://doi.org/10.1007%2F0-387-34805-0_22) In a private/public-key setting, a ZKPoK of posession of a private-key (e.g., a discrete-log of a point on an elliptic-curve) corresponding to a public-key, constitutes a digital signature of a message that is bound to the proof (usually via hashing), since only someone knowledgeable of the private-key could have produced the proof in connection with said message.
