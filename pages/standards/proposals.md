In preparation for every workshop, the community submits papers on the security, implementation and applications of zero-knowledge proofs. If accepted, the papers are to be discussed at the upcoming workshop with the goal to convey and facilitate progress in zero-knowledge proof technology, by sharing knowledge among participants and by creating public living documents that convey the state of the art. Submissions can be along the following tracks:

- **Community Proposals** serve as references and guidelines agreed upon by the community, that promote correct usage and interoperability of zero-knowledge proofs. We envision that subsequent work, to be defined in collaboration with standard bodies, will be required to gain official status as a normative standard.
- **Systematization-of-Knowledge (SoK)** papers serve to map the state of the art on some specific aspect of the workshopâ€™s scope. They should be comprehensive in covering the main approaches to that aspect, compare-and-contrast them, and offer effective conceptual frameworks for understanding the relations between these alternatives (e.g., models, distinguishing properties, metrics and decomposition into building blocks).
