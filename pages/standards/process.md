The ZKProof effort aims to develop specifications and standards that will support adoption of advanced cryptographic schemes, with deployment of secure and interoperable zero-knowledge proof systems.

The ZKProof Standards Committee was created in 2023, to develop a process for promotion of specifications and standards, and oversee the creation of corresponding working groups. It is inteded that working groups develop community proposals to faciliate progress in the field.

We expect to published in 2024 more details in this webpage.

Information of proposals submitted to workshops prior to 2022 can be found here [here](/standards/proposals).
