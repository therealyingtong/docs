# Community Standards

---


The ZKProof standardization effort is committed to fostering adoption of advanced cryptographic schemes, and as such, we aim to develop community-wide standards that will ensure the security and interoperability of deployed zero-knowledge systems.

This task starts by facilitating progress in the field, enabling the community to share knowledge and push the boundaries of research. The community is actively working to create up-to-date guidelines for best-practice usage of the technology. Furthermore, the community is contributing to develop educational material to support newcomers into the space.

The standardization process is being defined, and a formal version will be published [here](/docs/standards/process). 

You can find [here](/docs/standards/proposals) all the papers that were accepted to the previous workshops.
