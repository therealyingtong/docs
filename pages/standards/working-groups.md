This page collects links to all resources about working groups (WG) in the ZKProof Standardization effort, as well as proposals and systematizations of knowledge submitted to ZKProof workshops.

For comments and updates, please email `editors at zkproof dot org`.

**About Proposals vs. WGs vs. Standards:** Throughout various ZKProof workshops, "proposals" were submitted for discussion by the community. Some of these led to the creation of "working groups" (WG) intended to subsequently develop/refine/improve the proposals, possibly toward future standards. Information about other proposals can be found in the _Community Standards_ section under ["Accepted Papers"](https://docs.zkproof.org/standards/proposals).
