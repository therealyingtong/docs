## ZKProof Charter

*First established in Boston, May 10th and 11th 2018.*

The goal of the ZKProof Standardization effort is to advance the use of Zero Knowledge Proof technology by bringing together experts from industry and academia. To further the goals of the effort, we set the following guiding principles:

- The initiative is aimed at producing documents that are open for all and free to use.◦As an open initiative, all content issued from the ZKProof Standards Workshop is underCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.
- We seek to represent all aspects of the technology, research and community in an inclusive manner.
- Our goal is to reach consensus where possible, and to properly represent conflicting views where consensus was not reached.
- As an open initiative, we wish to communicate our results to the industry, the media and to thegeneral public, with a goal of making all voices in the event heard.
    - Participants in the event might be photographed or filmed.
    - We encourage you to tweet, blog and share with the hashtag #ZKProof. Our official twitterhandle is @ZKProof.

## Intellectual Property Policy

ZKProof is an open initiative that seeks to promote the secure and interoperable use of zero-knowledge proofs. To foster open development and wide adoption, it is valuable to promote tech-nologies with open-source implementations, unencumbered by royalty-bearing patents. However,some useful technologies may fall within the scope of patent claims.  

Since ZKProof seeks torepresent the technology, research and community in an inclusive manner, it is valuable to setexpectations about the disclosure of intellectual property and the handling of patent claims.The members of the ZKProof community are hereby strongly encouraged to provide informationon known patent claims (their own and those from others) potentially applicable to the guidance,requirements, recommendations, proposals and examples provided in ZKProof documentation, in-cluding by disclosing known pending patent applications or any relevant unexpired patent. Partic-ularly, such disclosure is promptly required from the patent holders, or those acting on their behalf,as a condition for providing content contributions to the “Community Reference” and to “Proposals” submitted to ZKProof for consideration by the community. The ZKProof documentation willbe updated based on received disclosures about pertinent patent claims.

ZKProof aims to produce documents that are open for all and free to use.  As such, the con-tent produced for publication within the context of the ZKProof Standardization effort should bemade available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. Furthermore, anytechnology that is promoted in said ZKProof documentation and that falls within patent claimsshould be made available under licensing terms that are reasonable, and demonstrably free of unfairdiscrimination, preferably allowing free open-source implementations.
