## ZKProof Charter

*First established in Boston, May 10th and 11th 2018.*

The goal of the ZKProof Standardization effort is to advance the use of Zero Knowledge Proof technology by bringing together experts from industry and academia. To further the goals of the effort, we set the following guiding principles:

- The initiative is aimed at producing documents that are open for all and free to use.◦As an open initiative, all content issued from the ZKProof Standards Workshop is underCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.
- We seek to represent all aspects of the technology, research and community in an inclusive manner.
- Our goal is to reach consensus where possible, and to properly represent conflicting views where consensus was not reached.
- As an open initiative, we wish to communicate our results to the industry, the media and to thegeneral public, with a goal of making all voices in the event heard.
    - Participants in the event might be photographed or filmed.
    - We encourage you to tweet, blog and share with the hashtag #ZKProof. Our official twitterhandle is @ZKProof.

## Intellectual Property Policy

ZKProof is an open initiative that seeks to promote the secure and interoperable use of zero-knowledge proofs. To foster open development and wide adoption, it is valuable to promote technologies with open-source implementations unencumbered by royalty-bearing patents. However, some useful technologies may fall within the scope of patent claims. Since ZKProof seeks to represent the technology, research and community in an inclusive manner, it is valuable to set expectations about the disclosure of intellectual property and the handling of patent claims.

The members of the ZKProof community are hereby strongly encouraged to provide information on known patent claims potentially applicable to the guidance, requirements, recommendations, proposals and examples provided in ZKProof documentation, including by disclosing known pending patent applications or any relevant unexpired patent. Particularly, such disclosure is promptly required from the patent holders, or those acting on their behalf, as a condition for providing content contributions to the ZKProof Community Reference and to Proposals submitted to ZKProof for consideration by the community. Furthermore, any technology that is promoted in said ZKProof documentation and that falls within patent claims should be made available under licensing terms that are reasonable, and demonstrably free of unfair discrimination, preferably allowing free open-source implementations.

ZKProof aims to produce documents that are open for all and free to use. As such, all content issued from the ZKProof Standards effort is under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. The ZKProof documentation will be updated based on received disclosures about pertinent patent claims. Please email information to editors@zkproof.org.
